============
Introduction
============

Crystal Toolkit is a web app framework from the `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org>`_
allowing Python developers to easily make an interactive web app to display materials science information.
As a showcase of the framework's capabilities, the Crystal Toolkit app allows you to import, view, analyze and
transform crystal structures and molecules.

Crystal Toolkit App
-------------------

You can visit the current Crystal Toolkit web app `here. <https://materialsproject.org/#apps/xtaltoolkit>`_

.. warning::
  While the web app is online, the Crystal Toolkit source code itself is not
  intended for public use at this time. The current master branch **may not work**,
  and **documentation may be incomplete and/or misleading.**
  We're working hard to reach release status, please check back soon.

Crystal Toolkit Framework
-------------------------

Crystal Toolkit is designed as a modular, object-orientated suite of UI components
built upon the `Dash framework by Plotly <https://dash.plot.ly>`_. The main Crystal Toolkit web app is just
one example of using these components.

Installation
------------

You can ``pip install crystal-toolkit``.

For Jupyter integration, please see the `additional installation steps <jupyter>`_.


Running the App Locally
-----------------------

If the web app is offline or undergoing maintenance, you can also run the
web app locally using `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_. After you've
installed Docker, run the following:

::

    docker container run -p 8000:8000 -e PMG_MAPI_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE materialsproject/crystal_toolkit

The app should then be available at `<http://localhost:8000>`_.

Make sure to set your ``PMG_MAPI_KEY`` appropriately.
If you need a Materials Project API key, please get a free account on
`Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org>`_ and access your dashboard.
